            <p class="Flex-Box-Center">Now Knowing what the abilities of these cards do we can look at how they 
                would interact in combat. Let's say Atushi was attacking and Thornweald
                 wanted to block. Thornweald is able to block atushi because it has reach,
                  meaning it is able to block flying creatures. Now we move to the combat, 
                  Atsushi would deal 4 damage to Thornweald, since Atushi has trample and
                   Thornweald is only a 2/1 Thornweald will die and 3 damage will be carried
                    over to the player. At the same time Thornweald will deal 2 damage to Atsushi.
                     And because Thornweald has deathtouch Atushi will also die.</p>
